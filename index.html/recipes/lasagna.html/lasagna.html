        <p>Optional:</p>

        <ul>We have a recipe here if you want to make your own <a href="file:///home/lanie/repos/odin-recipes/index.html/recipes/pasta-sauce.html/pasta-sauce.html">pasta sauce</a></ul>

        <p>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt and a little olive oil to the pot. Add noodles and cook until al dente.</p>
        <p>Pre-heat your oven to 350</p>
        <p>For your meat mixture:</p>
        <p>Heat a medium skillet and add your olive oil, finely diced onion and ground beef. Brown your beef, drain and set aside.</p>
        <p>Mix ricotta and parmesan in a bowl with your Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.</p>   
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil your noodles</li>
            <li>Brown your meat mixture</li>
            <li>In a glass pan pour some of your sauce, mix the remainder of the sauce into your meat mixture</li>
            <li>On top of the sauce create a layer of noodles</li>
            <li>Spread an even layer cheese</li>
            <li>Top with the meat and sauce mix</li>
            <li>Repeat until you have at least three layers</li>
            <li>Save enough of the cheese mix to make a layer</li>
